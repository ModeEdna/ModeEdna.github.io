        "# Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, as we wrap up our analysis, we would like to propose several ideas for future work.\n",
        "\n",
        "### More Thorough Training\n",
        "\n",
        "The most glaring place for improvement that we see with our analysis lies in the model training process. Of course, as mentioned, we were able to run our models using Google Colab's GPU resources to a certain extent, but eventually exhausted those resources. We believe that having access to more powerful resources while training our model would lead us to more successful results in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "### More Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Another place for improvement that we recognize relates to the size of our data. Although we have nearly 5,000 prompts and associated Python code blocks, our dataset still remains very small at approximately 1.1 MB. We realize that having access to more data for use in our model training process could also lead to more desirable results in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way in which we can increase the size of our dataset is through *Data Augmentation*. Here, we can replace variable names in the Python code blocks in order to generate similar but different code blocks for each prompt. This way, we increase the size of our dataset and allow our model to get a better understanding of Python syntax and structure, rather than focusing on variable names themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Optimize the Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The last article of improvement that we would like to recognize regards the model itself. With more exhaustive hyperparameter tuning, we believe that we could improve our results. For instance, given unlimited resources, we would like to experiment with differing batch sizes, scheduled learning rates, and model choices. With this approach, we believe that we could find the optimal parameters for our model."
