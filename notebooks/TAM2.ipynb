To do this, I first had to merge seven tables to have all the required information in one dataframe. From there, I cleaned the data, homogenizing naming conventions and ensuring there were no outliers or nonsensical data points. I had to remove variables that didn't help predict the market size. The performance of the regression model was good, with the following values:\n","\n","r2: 0.73\n","\n","MAPE: 11.2%\n","\n","For reference, the model was trying to predict the available market per month based on factors such as GDP, specific sector growth, etc. The estimate was made as units sold.\n","\n","Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the data, so I can't replicate the model here and show appropriate illustrations.
